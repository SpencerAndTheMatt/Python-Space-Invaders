# Python-Space-Invaders
Using pygame and a tutorial from freeCodeCamp, developed a simple space invaders game.
This repository contains all the music/sound files required for the game to function.
Everywhere I got the music/sound/images from are embedded within the source code in the form of commented links.
Enjoy!
